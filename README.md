In this project, the orbit of the moon was computed using scipy.integrate. It was then extended to compute the orbit of a probe around the moon, from an Earth frame of reference. 

## Goals
- To use numerical approaches to explore the motion of satellites
- To learn more about the integration methods provided by scipy.integrate
- Applying differential equations to model a real world scenario

## Folders used
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Equations considered
### Moon around the Earth
